# TicTacToe

This is TicTacToe game at 3x3 board with saving logs, but only in console. <br/>
I used Python 3.9, but some lower version should work too. There is no other libs. <br/>
I add some "fancy" looking lanes to show a way, that player win a game, if he won. <br/>
There are also logs, that are stored in logs.txt, and they are always subbmited with final summary session result. <br/>
Maybe in future I will add something more, but for now, that's all. <br/>
